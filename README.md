The `devops` cli tool is created for maintainers. Are you repeatedly typing git commands to merge pull requests? That's
what this tool does for you. All you need to remember are a handful of commands and the git commands will be handled
for you. It's based on the Zend Framework maintainers workflow so be sure to check out if it works for your workflow
as well.
